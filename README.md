## HexFlow UCTV
is a custom edit/hack/fork for PSTV/VITA TV of [HexFLow Unofficial Custom](https://github.com/BlackSheepBoy69/HexFlow-Launcher-Unofficial-Custom).
Every aspect found on the original launcher applies, please support the main release.

### Features/Changes
* Removed WiFi, Clock and Battery indicators.
* Removed display of Switch Menu features ([still accesible by pressing down, text will display them](https://github.com/royepi/HexFlow-UCTV/blob/main/Screens/Switch%20view%20with%20%20options%20highlighted.png?raw=true)).
* Changed font to make it more on brand.
* Switched default wallpaper to Playstation Pattern.
* Changed name of backgrounds accordingly on text files.
* Edited [screens](https://github.com/royepi/HexFlow-UCTV/blob/main/Screens/Launcher%20splash.png?raw=true) and [bubble](https://github.com/royepi/HexFlow-UCTV/blob/main/Screens/Bubble%20on%20main%20menu.png?raw=true) just to differentiate it.

### Still working on
* Editing font, can't display Japanese characters ([but you can rename games in launcher](https://github.com/royepi/HexFlow-UCTV/blob/main/Screens/Renamed%20Japanese%20game.png?raw=true)).
* Still learning how to implement features from other launchers.

### Tips & Thoughts
* I recommend changing Category Button to UP/DOWN and Theme to Black.
* ID for AutoBoot is "HFTV00012".
* I have just checked it running PSV, PSP, PS1 and HB, haven't tried with emulators.
  
<p>Hope you enjoy it.<p>
