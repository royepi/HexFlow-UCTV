# HexFlow UCTV
is a custom edit/hack/fork for PSTV/VITA TV of [HexFLow Unofficial Custom](https://github.com/BlackSheepBoy69/HexFlow-Launcher-Unofficial-Custom).
Every aspect found on the original launcher applies, please support the main release.

## Features/Changes
* Removed WiFi, Clock and Battery indicators.
* Removed display of Switch Menu features (still accesible by pressing down, text will display them).
* Changed font to make it more on brand.
* Switched default wallpaper to Playstation Pattern.
* Changed name of backgrounds accordingly on text files.
* Edited screens and bubble just to differentiate it.

# Still working on
<p>Editing font, can't display Japanese characters (but you can rename games in launcher).<p>

# Tips & Thoughts
* I recommend changing Category Button to UP/DOWN and Theme to Black.
* ID for AutoBoot is "HFTV00012".
* I have just checked it running PSV, PSP, PS1 and HB, haven't tried with emulators.
  
<p>Hope you enjoy it.<p>
