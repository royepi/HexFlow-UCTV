# HexFlow-Launcher-Unofficial-Custom
is a custom edit/hack/fork for PSTV/VITA TV of HexFLow Unofficial Custom.
Every aspect found on the original launcher applies, please support the main

Features/Changes:

*Removed WiFi, Clock and Battery indicators.
*Removed display of Switch Menu features (still accesible by pressing down, text will display them)
*Changed font to make it more on brand.
*Switched default wallpaper to Playstation Pattern.
*Changed name of backgrounds accordingly on text files.
*Edited screens and bubble just to differentiate it.

Still working:

-Editing font, can't display Japanese characters (But you can rename games in launcher).

I recommed changing Category Button to UP/DOWN and Theme to Black. ID for AutoBoot is "HFTV00012".
I have just checked it running PSV, PSP, PS1 and HB, haven't tried with emulators.

Hope you enjoy it.
