<p>Display and launch your games and homebrews in style.<br /><strong>HexFlow Launcher</strong> features a 3d user interface to display your games with their box art and supports many customization options like custom covers, backgrounds, and - in v0.6 and above - one custom category.</p>
<p>Launching a game/app from <strong>HexFlow Launcher</strong> will close the launcher automaticaly without asking.</p>
<h2>Custom Covers</h2>
<p>Place your custom covers in "<em>ux0:/data/HexFlow/COVERS/PSVITA/</em>"</p>
<p>Cover images must be in <strong>png</strong> format and the file name must match the <strong>App ID</strong> or the <strong>App Name</strong> of each app (recomended resolution 256x256px). <a href="https://live.staticflickr.com/7176/6885249717_738e8ee187_n.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sample vita cover image</a></p>
<h3>Download Covers and Backgrounds</h3>
<p>In v0.3 and above, covers can be downloaded automatically from the settings menu (Start button). You can also download covers and backgrounds manually from the link below. Thanks to <b>astuermer</b> for creating <a href="https://github.com/andiweli/hexflow-covers">the original cover archive</a> used in v0.9.1 and below, and big thanks to <b>jimbob4000</b> for maintaining the current cover archive.</p>

<h3>Custom Background</h3>
<p>Place your <strong>Background.png</strong> or <strong>Background.jpg</strong> image in "<em>ux0:/data/HexFlow/</em>" (recomended resolution 1280x720px or less). Some custom backgrounds are available <a href="https://github.com/andiweli/hexflow-covers/tree/main/Backgrounds">HERE</a>. In v0.9 and above, these sample custom backgrounds are included by default.</p>
<h3>Custom Category</h3>
<p>In v0.6 and above, take the <strong>applist.dat</strong> file in "<em>ux0:data/HexFlow/</em>" and rename it to <strong>customsort.dat</strong>. This will generate a 5th category - "Custom" - and you can put what games you want or reorder it within Vitashell, or on your PC in a unix-compatible text editor such as gVim Easy. Windows notepad won't work.</p>
<h3>Custom Music</h3>
<p>Place your  <strong>Music.ogg</strong> or <strong>Music.mp3</strong> file in "<em>ux0:data/HexFlow/</em>" (music will play automaticaly when the "Sounds" option is enabled)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>AutoBoot</h2>
<p>If you want to auto-launch <strong>HexFlow Launcher</strong> every time your PS Vita boots up you can use the <a href="https://vitadb.rinnegatamante.it/#/info/261" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>AutoBoot</strong></a> plugin by Rinnegatamante.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Controls</h2>
<p>Navigate your library using the <strong>DPad</strong> or the <strong>Left Stick</strong> or with the <strong>Touch Screen</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>R/L triggers</strong>: Skip 5 items</p>
<p><strong>Select+R/L triggers</strong>: Skip by alphabet</p>
<p><strong>Cross</strong>: Select/Launch game/app</p>
<p><strong>Square</strong>: Change Category</p>
<p><strong>Triangle</strong>: Game Details</p>
<p><strong>Circle</strong>: Change View/Cancel</p>
<p><strong>Start</strong>: Settings menu</p>
<p><strong>DPad Up/Down</strong>: Access SwitchView UI menu</p>
<p><strong>In v1.0 and above, DPad Up/Down can either be used to access SwitchView UI menu, or to change category if either of these options are enabled in the Settings menu</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>IMPORTANT</h3>
<p>For PSP bubbles generated by Adrenaline Bubbles Manager you must set the value of <strong>BubbleID</strong> to <strong>TitleID</strong> in the settings menu of ABM tool. In v0.9 and above, PS1 Bubble ID doesn't matter because it's scanned in binary during the startup.</p>
<p><strong>Subfolders and psp categories plugin are not supported</strong>.</p>

<h2>User Feature Requests</h2>
<p>Feature requests and "issues" posted on Retroflow & HexFlow Launcher are considered for being added to this list. Mostly no feature is impossible because there are experienced coders involved in the HexLauncher Custom project, but this entire project is just for me (only posted publicly out of the "generousity of my heart") so only features that I like will get added.</p>
<p>If you'd like to try coding up a feature (which may be faster than having me do it), then take your editted sourcecode and name it to "index.lua" and put it in like this: ux0:/app/HXLC00001/index.lua</p>
<p>...Or put it directly into the vpk (openable with Winrar) to replace the index.lua there.</p>
<p>The great feature of lua files is they can open in a simple text editor such as Notepad, and you don't need VitaSDK.</p>
<p>If your version works out, send it here as a github "pull request" and I'll see about adding your feature to this project so it can stay as the app updates. Otherwise you'll basicly have to wait for next release and hope I added a feature you want.<p>
