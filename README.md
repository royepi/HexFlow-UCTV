Every aspect found on the original launcher applies, please support the main

# Features/Changes:

<p>*Removed WiFi, Clock and Battery indicators.<p>

<p>*Changed font to make it more on brand.<p>
<p>*Switched default wallpaper to Playstation Pattern.<p>
<p>*Changed name of backgrounds accordingly on text files.<p>

-Editing font, can't display Japanese characters (But you can rename games in launcher)

I recommed changing Category Button to UP/DOWN and Theme to Black. ID for AutoBoot is "HFTV00012".
I have just checked it running PSV, PSP, PS1 and HB, haven't tried with emulators.
Hope you enjoy it.
